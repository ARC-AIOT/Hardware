# 1)Introduction
Our work is Smart Medication Use Support System. The purpose is to help the elderly solve problem of forgetting to take medicineï¼Œ our work can identify how many times a day the medicine should be taken that written on the medicine bag to remind the user to take the medicine at the specified time.

Connect all components as picture show.


### Compile the prog
(Please use following cmd in linux system only, you need to download [Synopsys_SDK_V22.01/](https://arc.synopsys.com.tw/resourceDetail/6) by yourself beforehand.)
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ARC-AIOT/Hardware
$ mv Hardware Synopsys_SDK_V22.01/
$ cd Synopsys_SDK_V22.01/Hardware/combine
$ make && make flash
```
Upload the prog to the board (see instruction below), press the rst btn and enjoy  
### Upload the prog
1. Use 'make' and 'make flash' command in cygwin and ubuntu to get the image file
2. Short J11 and J20
3. Burn the image file into the board
4. Open J11 and J20
5. Press the reset button to initialize the system

# 3)User Manual

### Basic Flow
1. After pressing reset button,set up the time by 'Time setting'
2. Choose 'text detect' to ask the device read information
3. If recognization success then go on,if failed back to step 2
4. Choose your next medication time
5. Take medicine on time with the notification of our device  
6. If you want to put a new bag of medicine, just start from step 2

### The detail instruction of each step can be found below

### Function Overview
* Time setting:
    Setup system time
* text detect:
    Using camera to recognize proper frequency to take medicine
* When to take med:
    Show and read out when you should take medicine next time  

**Mind:**   
    One should setup system time before using text detect to ensure the system work properly.  

### Main menu
You should see the menu from OLED like this once you open the device:
